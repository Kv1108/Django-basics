What is Django?
Django is a Python framework that makes it easier to create web sites using Python.
emphasizes reusability of components, also referred to as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

MVT design pattern (Model View Template).
Model - The data you want to present, usually data from a database.
View - A request handler that returns the relevant template and content - based on the request from the user.
Template - A text file (like an HTML file) containing the layout of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.

Model
The model provides data from the database.
located in a file called models.py.

View
A view is a function or method that takes http requests as arguments, imports the relevant model(s), and finds out what data to send to the template, and returns the final result.
located in a file called views.py.

Template
A template is a file where you describe how the result should be represented.
.html files, located in a folder named templates.

URLs
a way to navigate around the different pages in a website.
When a user requests a URL, Django decides which view it will send it to.
done in a file called urls.py.

basically what happens:
Django receives the URL, checks the urls.py file, and calls the view that matches the URL.
The view, located in views.py, checks for relevant models.
The models are imported from the models.py file.
The view then sends the data to a specified template in the template folder.
The template contains HTML and Django tags, and with the data it returns finished HTML content back to the browser.

What is an App?
An app is a web application that has a specific meaning in your project, like a home page, a contact form, or a members database.

In Django, data is created in objects, called Models, and is actually tables in a database.

A QuerySet is a collection of data from a database.
