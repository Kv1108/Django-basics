# Django-basics 🚀

A personal repository to document my **Django learning journey**, covering core concepts, hands-on examples, and gradual improvements as I build Django apps and explore framework fundamentals.

## 📌 About

This project acts as a sandbox for learning Django — the powerful Python web framework used for building database-driven web applications. Django follows the **Model-View-Template (MVT)** architecture and comes with a built-in admin interface, authentication, ORM, and more.

Here, I experiment with:
- Django project setup
- Routing & URLs
- Views (Function- & potentially Class-Based)
- Templates & static files
- Models & database interactions
- Forms & user input
- Other core Django features
